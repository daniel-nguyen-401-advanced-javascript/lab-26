## Challenge
    
Your ToDo application should have the following features:

* Users should have access to a form where a new ToDo task can be added. This form should have the following fields:
    * Task Description / Text
    * Assigned To
    * Status (complete or incomplete)
    * Difficulty (a number between 1 and 5)

* When users submit their new task form, they should see their task appear in a list of current tasks. This list should allow you to select any task to toggle it from complete to incomplete or vice versa.
    * For this lab, your application does not have to persist tasks after application reload / refresh.

* The title on the browser tab should update to show the number of incomplete tasks. For example, the title could read “4 Incomplete ToDo Items” or something similar.
